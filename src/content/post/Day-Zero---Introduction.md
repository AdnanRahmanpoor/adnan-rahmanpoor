Welcome to the blog.

## About ME

The name is Adnan. I'm just a person who enjoys opening VS Code (maybe NeoVim too) and a terminal, write some code and stare at the screen for 12 hours a day. Am I a developer? No idea.

I understand the basics, the concepts but tell me to build an app, a web page, I might do it at times, or not get anywhere. It's a learning process. One day it will click for sure.

My main language is Python, just love it. It's as if I'm talking to a person (my computer) when writing some code with it. The main focus is Data Analysis and hopefully Machine Learning and more advanced things.

I also love web development, have some pretty good experience in Javascript (TypeScript), React, Next.JS and AstroJS. Built few basics websites, very basic.
Other languages are Flutter, R, C# and now PHP.

I also utilize the tools of Ai, such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Perplexity Ai to code and I have built few apps using them, which will be showcased here in future blog posts.

## What to expect from this blog

In this blog, I’ll be writing about:

* **Programming Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides on how to approach certain problems, and leverage tools like Docker, GitHub Actions, and more.
* **Coding Projects**: A detailed look at the coding projects I’m working on.
* **Data Science and AI**: Insights into data analysis, data visualization, and how artificial intelligence is impacting various industries.
* **Automation Tips**: How I’m automating different aspects of development, from deploying apps to sharing updates on social media.

This is by no means a professional blog, it's just another project that I want to work on and to document my journey while I dive deep in the realm of codes and tech and the future.

So I welcome you to this Blog site, I hope we both learn, enjoy and progress in life.
